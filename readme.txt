== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I customize wordpress and WooCommerce emails? =
After installing Mail Control, you can access the Email customizer to design you emails (you will be able to select what email to customize) and send a preview email before activating the feature.

= Why should I use an Email Tracker to track Email Opening and clicks? =

If your recipient receives your email, don't you want to know? Is it in his spam folder? Is the email subject clear enough that he actually opens the email? is your call to action compelling enough so he clicks on it?

What if you notice that a visitor reads you email multiple times? isn't it a good indicator that he is interested in what you are selling? maybe you should contact him again...

Email Tracking will help you detect problems and opportunities so you can take action, it is an invaluable tool for the great marketer.

With this plugin, you will be able to test your domain name's SPF, DKIM and DMARC records and have actionable suggestions to fix any detected issue.

As it is an experimental feature for now, we can assist you if you need any help.

= How can I defer sending the emails and why should I? =

With this plugin, you can activate the Background Mailer, this will defer sending the email to a background cron job.

This will speed up your pages and response times and more importantly avoid any critical timeout error in your checkout experience.

= Will Mail Control work with my theme and other plugins like WooCommerce or Contact Form 7 ? =

Probably, as long as your theme or plugin doesn't override the wp_mail function. Mail Control should work just fine.

As tested now, mail control is compatible with "Contact Form 7" and "WooCommerce".

= Can Mail Control send emails using Gmail? =
